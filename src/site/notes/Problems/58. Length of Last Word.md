## Problem Description
Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return _the length of the **last** word in the string._

A **word** is a maximal 

substring

 consisting of non-space characters only.
### Examples
**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "Hello World"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The last word is "World" with length 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The last word is "moon" with length 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "luffy is still joyboy"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be at least one word in `s`.
## Solutions
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int LengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int lastSpaceIndex = s.Length;
        bool found = false;
        //Iterate from the end of the string
        for(int i = s.Length -1; i >= 0  ; i--)
        {
            // If a word was found already and a space is found
            if(s[i] == ' ' && found)
            {
                return (lastSpaceIndex - 1) - i;
            }
            // If Iterating a word
            if(s[i] != ' ')
            {
                found = true;
            }
            // If Iterating through spaces at the end before finding a word
            else
            {
                lastSpaceIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return lastSpaceIndex;
    }
}
```
## Explanation
1. Initialize variables:
	1. `lastSpaceIndex` to store the index of the last space found  
	2. `found` to store if a word has been found already
2. Start iterating from the end
3. Check if a space is found.
	1. If a word was already `found`, return `(lastSpaceIndex - 1) - i` which is the number of indices iterated between the space found and the previous one.
4. If a word is found
	1. Set `found` flag as `true`
5. Otherwise, a space is found before any word
	1. Increase `lastSpaceIndex` to correctly track when the last word starts.
6. return `lastSpaceIndex`, in case the iteration finishes, it should correspond with the last space on the outer right

#### Complexity
