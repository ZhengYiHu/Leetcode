## Problem Description
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.
### Examples
**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
**Output:** 4
### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` contains **distinct** values sorted in **ascending** order.
- `-104 <= target <= 104`
## Solutions
```C#
public class Solution {
    public int SearchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
       
        return BinarySearch(nums,0,nums.Length - 1, target);
    }

    public int BinarySearch(int[] array, int left, int right, int target)
    {
        if(left > right) return left;

        int half = (left + right)/2;
        if(array[half] == target)
        {
            return half;
        }
        else if(array[half] > target)
        {
            return BinarySearch(array, left, half - 1, target);
        }
        else
        {
            return BinarySearch(array, half + 1, right, target);
        }
    }
}
```
## Explanation
Simply use [Binary Search](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/binary-search#:~:text=Binary%20search%20is%20an%20efficient,game%20in%20the%20introductory%20tutorial.) algorithm to find the target value, since the array is already sorted:
1. Find the half point of the `array` and get the value found at that index
2. If the target is found at that index value, return it.
3. If the target is greater than the value, purge the left half and perform the same search on the right half via Recursion.
4. Likewise, if the target is lower than the value, purge the right half and perform the same search on the right half via Recursion.
5. Keep calling the recursive function until the value is found, or the right half's index is greater than the left half's. This means that the value was not found in the array.
